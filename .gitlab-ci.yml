# This is a GitLab CI configuration to build the project as a docker image
# The file is generic enough to be dropped in a project containing a working Dockerfile

# do not use "latest" here, if you want this to work in the future

stages:
  - build
  - push

variables:
  # fill those if you have a proxy in your environment

  https_proxy: ""

# Use this if your GitLab runner does not use socket binding

#   - docker:dind

before_script:
  # docker login asks for the password to be passed through stdin for security
  # we use $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD here which is a special variable provided by GitLab

  - echo -n $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD | docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER --password-stdin $CI_REGISTRY

Build:
  stage: build

    # fetches the latest image (not failing if image is not found)
    - docker pull $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest || true
    # builds the project, passing proxy variables, using OCI labels
    # notice the cache-from, which is going to use the image we just pulled locally
    # the built image is tagged locally with the commit SHA, and then pushed to 
    # the GitLab registry

# Finally, the goal here is to Docker tag any Git tag
# GitLab will start a new pipeline everytime a Git tag is created, which is pretty awesome
